# This is a terrible hack done in order to avoid excessive duplication
# of OEM IDs around the place. This ebuild basically serves as a
# Gentoo ebuild (duhâ€¦) and as a bash file to be sourced in order to
# get arch-specific information about possible OEM IDs. The latter
# role is assumed when the ebuild is sourced with first argument being
# 'flatcar-local-variables'. This role is used by our image-changes
# job. All this fluff needs to happen before we define or invoke any
# Gentoo-specific variables or functions like "EAPI" or "inherit" that
# may mess up sourcing.
#
# This can't be done with a separate shell file in FILESDIR (I tried),
# because portage moves the ebuild into some temporary directory where
# FILESDIR, although defined, does not even exist. Probably a security
# measure or something. So this needs to be done as
# all-in-terrible-one (as opposed to all-in-wonder-one).
