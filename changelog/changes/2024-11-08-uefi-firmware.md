- The UEFI firmware has changed from raw (.fd) format to QCOW2 format. In addition, the amd64 firmware variables are now held in a 4MB image rather than a 2MB image. Note that this firmware is only intended for testing with QEMU. Do not use it in production. ([scripts#2434](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/2434))
