- Added tmpfile rules to create missing folders, files, and symlinks under `/etc` and ship with an empty rootfs to ensure that we don't rely on files the updating machines may be missing and that all needed files have a tmpfile rule. To disable the creation of a file, symlink, or folder with the default contents, create an empty file or a symlink to `/dev/null` instead of removing it.
