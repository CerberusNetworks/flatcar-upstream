* Added [overlaybd](https://containerd.github.io/overlaybd/) system extension to support accelerated container images.
  The extension includes both [overlaybd](https://github.com/containerd/overlaybd/) as well as [accelerated-container-image](https://github.com/containerd/accelerated-container-image) tools.
  Add `overlaybd` to [`/etc/flatcar/enabled-sysext.conf`](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/provisioning/sysext/) to check it out.
