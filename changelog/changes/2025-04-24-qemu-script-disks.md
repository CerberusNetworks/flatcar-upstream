- The qemu script (`flatcar_production_qemu*.sh`) received two new options. `-D` (or `-image-disk-opts`) can be used to add extra options to the `virtio-blk-pci` device for primary disk. `-d` (or `-disk`) can be used to add extra disks to the machine - this one takes a path to a raw or qcow2 image file and, after a comma, `virtio-blk-pci` options. To learn what disk options can be passed to `-D` or `-d`, call `qemu-system-x86_64 -device virtio-blk-pci,help` (`qemu-system-aarch64` can be used too).
