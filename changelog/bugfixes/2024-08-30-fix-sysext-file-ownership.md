- Fix ownership of systemd units shipped with built-in docker/containerd sysexts. The files shipped on production images were accidentally owned by 1000:1000 instead of 0:0. This uid/gid is not present on Flatcar images but would be assigned to the first created user. Due to contents of sysexts and /usr being readonly on Flatcar, the invalid permissions can't be used to escalate privileges. ([scripts#2266](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/2266))
