# sdk_container_build() should be called w/ the positional INPUT parameters below.

# SDK container builder automation stub.
#  This script will build an SDK container w/ board support from an SDK tarball.
#  NOTE that SDK tarball and scripts repo must have the same version or building
#  the SDK container will fail.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
#   1. SDK version is recorded in sdk_container/.repo/manifests/version.txt and a matching
#       SDK tarball is available on BUILDCACHE/sdk/[ARCH]/[VERSION]/flatcar-sdk-[ARCH]-[VERSION].tar.bz2
#
# OPTIONAL INPUT:

#   2. ARCH. Environment variable. Target architecture for the SDK to run on.
#        Either "amd64" or "arm64"; defaults to "amd64" if not set.
#
# OUTPUT:
#
#   1. SDK container image of the new SDK, published to buildcache.
#   2. "./ci-cleanup.sh" with commands to clean up temporary build resources,
#        to be run after this step finishes / when this step is aborted.
